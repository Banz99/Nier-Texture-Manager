# Nier-Texture-Manager-PS3
This project is created to extract and repack textures from the game, rearranging pointers in the internal files whenever needed. Works almost 99% of the time when injecting textures with the same size as the original, 50% when injecting smaller ones and 10% when injecting bigger ones.
Uses LZO decompression library from:http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/ and the C# port located at: http://wallaceturner.com/lzo-for-c
